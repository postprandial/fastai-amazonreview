       "1                  I bought this on impulse and it comes from Japan,  which amused my family,  all those weird stamps and markings on the package. So that was fun.  It said it would take about a month to arrive and it did take that long.  I was hoping for a more interesting taste but to our family,  it just tasted a bit less flavorful or weaker than the standard milk chocolate kit kat.  The green tea flavor was too subtle for the sugar and it just tasted sweet. The wafers were very crispy, and that was good,  but it tasted a bit anemic to us.I'm happy I bought it, but don't need to buy it again.   \n",

       "4  I've been looking forward to trying these after hearing about how popular they were in Japan, and among Kit Kat fans as well. I do not recommend ordering these during warm weather, because they can melt and become smushy. I ordered mine right when summer began, and they were a bit mushy so I let them solidify under room temp. Afterwards, I tried some and they tasted fine. I was expecting a stronger green tea or matcha flavor, but it is actually quite subtle. The outer coating was creamy and not overly sugary, which I liked. Overall, I wouldn't say it's insanely good, but definitely a yummy...   \n",
